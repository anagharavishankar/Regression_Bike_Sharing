## General Information
> Building a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## Background
> A bike-sharing system provides access to bicycles for shared use to individuals for a short duration. These systems typically feature docks where users can borrow bikes after inputting payment details, with the bikes being returned to any dock within the same network.

## Trying to achieve
> The company aims to identify:
  - Significant variables that influence the demand for shared bikes.
  - The effectiveness of these variables in explaining variations in bike demand.

## Dataset Information
The dataset utilized is a CSV-formatted bike sharing dataset (day.csv), with each row representing the details of bike rented on a particular day ranging from start of 2018 to end of 2019.
